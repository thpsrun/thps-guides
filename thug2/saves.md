**Title**: Making Saves for THUG2  
**Website Tags**: Guide  
**Discovered By**: Community  
**Complexity**: Beginner  
  
**Description**: This guide will take you through making run-ready saves for Story Mode. 

As a reminder of the rules, your run will constitute as NG+ if:
1. You use unlockable tricks, including speed manuals such as Hot Rod or Paulie Butt Manual
2. You have more than the default number of special tricks (4)

Note: Hot Rod is unlocked by completing Classic Mode on Sick difficulty. Paulie Butt Manual is unlocked by completing Story Mode on Normal difficulty.

To make a save:  
1.  Create a skater if you please
2.  Create a graphic if you please
3.  Create whichever create-a-tricks you would like (see section: Create-A-Tricks)
4.  Save the game
5.  Go to story mode and start new story mode on whichever difficult you will be running. When you get to the training level, quit to the main menu. Do not gain any stats or **your runs will be invalid if you are running NG.**
6.  Go to high score/free skate. You can edit tricks on your create-a-skater, in addition to skaters you can play as in story mode. **Remember that binding Hot Rod and/or Paulie Butt Manual will constitute your file as a NG+ file.** Load and bind your CATs if you're using them.
7.  When you're done editing tricks, save the game.

Each time you start a new run you'll need to load the appropriate file.

**Create-A-Tricks (CATs)**
Useful CATs for the run include:
*   Sit Flip & Rocket Air (Berlin)
*   Double Kickflip (Australia)

To make a CAT:
*   Head to the create a trick menu. Make a 0.4s trick then name it and save it as one of the above. Remember to load it and bind it on the appropriate skater.
