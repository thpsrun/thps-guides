This project is synchronized with [thps.run](https://thps.run/). Whenever a pull request (PR) is approved to the `main` branch, the website will be automatically updated with the guide (or it should). The idea for this is to better imortalize our videos, guides, and information into a central place. Information is ephemeral; so we must do everything we can to preserve it.  
  
If you are interested in assisting with making guides, PRs are very much welcome! If you are unfamiliar with how GitHub, PRs, and all of that works, but still want to contribute a few guides, feel free to reach out to ThePackle or another contributor for assistance! We might be able ot make the PR for you.  

## Rules
To go with this, the following rules are to be followed; approvers must adhere to these rules too and ensure contributors understand:
1. **You MUST use the template below**. thps.run's workflow of serving .MD files is configured a specific way; there is no compromises. At the minimum, `Title`, `Website Tags`, `Discovered/Created By`, and `Complexity` are to be included.
2. Consistency with guides is key! Approvers are allowed to deny a PR if your style doesn't make sense. Outside of the first four lines, you **ARE** allowed to be expressive. However, if the style is crazy, we might ask for changes.
3. It is recommended you use a website like [StackEdit](https://stackedit.io/) to help make the markdown files in real-time. If there are any issues with formatting, let us know!
4. Within each directory, the names need to:
    *   Have a unique name (a "slug") to describe the file. No spaces. No special characters. All lowercase.
    *   Each file must end with ".md"
5. The usual Rules of Conduct still apply here. Don't be an idiot.
