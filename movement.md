## General Movement
## Gaining Speed
## Rail Hopping / Rail Dropdowns
The two most important mechanics to learn with movement is both Rail Hopping and Rail Dropdowns. Before I get into what they are and their differences, here is a quick definition:

**Rail Hopping**: Quickly jumping in and out of a rail to gain and keep maximum speed.
**Rail Dropdowns**: Quickly jumping onto a rail and dropping down in quick succession to gain and keep maximum speed.

The quick TL;DR of this section is that Rail Dropdowns are faster. Kinda, at least in some circumstances.


### Rail Hopping
Rail Hopping is the original form of this and involves, as the definiton I stated says, jumping onto a rail and "hopping." In all other Tony Hawk games, doing this usually gives you a severe penalty to grind balance immediately upon grinding again; this can be easily seen in other THPS games where you see the balance meter drastically go left or right on repeated rail hops. Even if you frame perfectly mash rail hops, you will bail eventually.

In Project 8, however, you can spam this infinitely... With a catch. You see, the penalty isn't applied to the balance meter at the *start* of the grind, the penalty is applied *during* the grind. As such, you could rail hop all day to gain speed, then immediately lose momentum on the balance meter and bail. This is more easily apparent in Grind Spot Challenges.

Rail Hopping is powerful in virtually every situation, except for going downhill where (obviously) momentum will take you downward. For uphills, you __*want*__ to use this as much as possible since (also obviously) you lose speed as you go up; with this, you keep most of your speed going up and have a good amount of speed on the top. And, for flat surfaces, you want to do this as much as possible, especially if you have no speed, bailed, or lost all of it someway.
