## General Movement
## Gaining Speed
## Rail Hopping / Rail Dropdowns
The two most important mechanics to learn with movement is both Rail Hopping and Rail Dropdowns. Before I get into what they are and their differences, here is a quick definition:

**Rail Hopping**: Quickly jumping in and out of a rail to gain and keep maximum speed.
**Rail Dropdowns**: Quickly jumping onto a rail and dropping down in quick succession to gain and keep maximum speed.

The quick TL;DR of this section is that Rail Dropdowns are faster. Kinda, at least in some circumstances.


## Rail Hopping
Rail Hopping is the original form of this and involves, as the definiton I stated says, jumping onto a rail and "hopping." In all other Tony Hawk games, doing this usually gives you a severe penalty to grind balance immediately upon grinding again; this can be easily seen in other THPS games where you see the balance meter drastically go left or right on repeated rail hops. Even if you frame perfectly mash rail hops, you will bail eventually.

In Project 8, however, you can spam this infinitely... With a catch. You see, the penalty isn't applied to the balance meter at the *start* of the grind, the penalty is applied *during* the grind. As such, you could rail hop all day to gain speed, then immediately lose momentum on the balance meter and bail. This is more easily apparent in Grind Spot Challenges.

Rail Hopping is powerful in virtually every situation, except for going downhill where (obviously) momentum will take you downward. For uphills, you __*want*__ to use this as much as possible since (also obviously) you lose speed as you go up; with this, you keep most of your speed going up and have a good amount of speed on the top. And, for flat surfaces, you want to do this as much as possible, especially if you have no speed, bailed, or lost all of it someway.

## Rail Dropdowns

## Pivots

This is speaking of pivots ***strictly*** in the sense of you jumping into or out of it. Pivots are used mid-manual a lot due to an easy way to increase the multiplier in a combo or just to mess around when waiting for the timer to expire.

Pivots are a new tech added to the Rank 1 route; its viability was discovered by ThePackle and added into the route to circumvent some goals. Pivots pressed with R2/RT and usually spin the skater in place, especially. Pivots have some very strange mechanics compared to other tricks in the game, namely to "cut" corners in gaps or goals.

To start, the maximum number of pivots that can be used in an __entire__ combo is 4; afterwards your combo will drop completely. The very first pivot you do has no real slowdown, with subsequent ones (regardless of where they are in the combo) slowing your down further and further until your speed is 0. As such, pivots are situational at best.

An easy to way to do this is doing the "Around the Sac" gap in Suburbia. Usually, you must grind around the entire cul de sac, but this trick allows you to start the first jump, jump into a pivot to the right, then collect the gap much quicker [1].

Another example, in a goal setting, is the City Park Distance Spot Challenge. The original idea was that you needed to jump through the Factory, do a large acid drop, and go into a Nail-the-Trick and pray, but this was simplified due to the ability to just grind right, circle around, and get to the Sick marker more easily [2]. In the newest version of this, we cut some more time from this goal by using pivots to make the initial jump easier to hit AND cut out some slow grind stalls just to turn around! [3]

Obviously, goals and gaps that loop in on themselves can allow you to abuse this new power. Unfortunately there aren't a whole lot of goals in THP8 that loop in on themselves, then you have to remember you need to pass through the AM, Pro, AND Sick markers in order.
