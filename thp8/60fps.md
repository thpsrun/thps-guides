**Title**: How to remove updates, enabling 60fps mode  
**Website Tags**: Guide, THP8  
**Created By**: Heki  
**Complexity**: All Levels  

**Description**: The reason you want to do this is to make the game run faster, the game will not hit a smooth 60fps (Hence the patch) but it will run better overall and save a bunch of time when talking to npc's or using focus etc.
